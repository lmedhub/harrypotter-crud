I went a bit beyond the scope of the test because I wanted to practice a bit more on NextJS's backend functionalities. So, when a character is favorited, it is not saved on a global state or the browser storage, but on a database. With that, the user can access his favorited characters in different computers and we can create a statistics dashboard for admin users to see the houses of the characters that are favorited more frequently by all users.
